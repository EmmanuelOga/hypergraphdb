From the perspective of an application using HyperGraphDB, the main entry point is the `HyperGraph` class. This class operates at the level of the graph, handling operations such as adding and removing nodes and links, constructing run-time instances out of their types, managing predefined indexes and queries. The `HGTypeSystem` class manages hypergraph types and their mappings to Java types.  The `HGStore` class handles low-level storage and indexing operations and interacts directly with a Berkeley DB data store. The query system implements low-level querying operations â€“ low-level here meaning at the level of the database layout as detailed in the section on the `HGStore` below.
