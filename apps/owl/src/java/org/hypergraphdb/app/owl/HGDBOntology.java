/**
 * HGDBMutableOntology declares methods to enable initialization after instantiation.
 * This is for Hypergraph Bean introspection.
 * 
 * Extension was necessary for three situations:
 * A) No default constructor
 * Need a way to set fields after new default.
 * These might be huge objects that shall not be serialized by Hypergraph.
 * Therefore these methods are marked with @HGIgnore 
 * 
 * B) Only getter in superclass 
 * We sometimes want Hypergraph to use Bean Introspection and add a setter here.
 * 
 * C) Document IRI 
 * Physical location in DB.
 * 
 * Only Hypergraph should use those methods. All others should rely on the Change mechanism.
