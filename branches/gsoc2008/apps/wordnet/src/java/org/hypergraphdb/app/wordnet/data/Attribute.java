/**
 * 
 * <p>
 * Semantic link between adjectives and nouns. It can go in either direction
 * (nound->adjective or adjective->noun). It doesn't seem very clear to me how attributes
 * are defined in WordNet as it documentation is rather slim (actually non-existing) on
 * the subject. It looks like an <code>Attribute</code> relation exists between a noun
 * and an adjective synset whenever the adjective can express some attribute value for the noun.
 * The example given in the WordNet manpage is the adjective "heavy" that can be an attribute of
 * the noun "weight". It seems that in the WordNet DB, those links are either defined for the
 * adjective synset or the noun synset, but not for both even though the relation is in
 * fact unidirectional (i.e. "adjective A can be an attribute of noun N"). So maybe we need
 * to change our representation to consolidate this and create HGDB links where the first
 * target is always the adjective synset and the second is always the noun synset. There a little
 * above a 1000 of those in WordNet 2.1.
