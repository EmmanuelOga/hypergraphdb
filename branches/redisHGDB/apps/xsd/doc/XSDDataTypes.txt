XML Schema has a fairly standard approach to typing. There is a set of well-defined
primitive types which corresponding to a specific range of values. And there are
means to construct complex types. Each type, wheather primitive or complex is
uniquely identified in the global XML namespace schema of things (i.e. by a 
[URI, localLabel] pair usually written as http://blabla.blaba.com/somenamespace#somename).


The representation of XML Schema types in HyperGraph works as follows:

- Each and every XML Schema type has a corresponding atom which is a HGAtomType. 
- The runtime instance of the XSD primitive types are constructed by a XSDPrimitiveType 
constructor which has a statically defined mapping between their persistence handles
and run-time singletons.
