<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>
This release is a maintenance release containing many small improvements across
the different sub-systems of the database. A list of changes can be found at:
</p>

<a href="http://www.hypergraphdb.org/learn?page=NextReleaseNotes&project=hypergraphdb">
Changes for HyperGraphDB, Release 1.1</a> wiki page.

<p>
The most notable improvements in this release are:

<ol>
<li>Implementation of full MVCC transactions with unbounded read isolation. Both
the RAM cache of atoms and on disk storage are manipulated and synchronized 
through MVCC transactions and one can traverse an unlimited number of atoms in an
isolated transaction without locking/blocking and without running out of memory.</li>
<li>
Refactoring of the low-level storage implementation to allow for easier customization
of back-end storage, handle (i.e. id) generation and type system boostrapping. All
those were architecturally possible in the previous release, but there wasn't explicit
API support for them.
</li>
<li>
Numerous bug fixes and adjustments based on user feedback since the 1.0 release.
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Thank you for downloading the HyperGraphDB distribution, release 1.1. 
HyperGraphDB is an innovative database management system geared towards 
the complexities and open-endedness of modern, data intensive
information systems, in particular the semantic web, artificial intelligence,
networks research and object-orientation. 
</p>
<p>
HyperGraphDB is an embedded database, based on the Java platform and the 
robust and high-performance BerkeleyDB storage system.
</p>
<a name="install">
<h2>System Requirements and Installation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Java 5 or later is required to compile and/or run HyperGraphDB.</li>
<li>A fairly recent version of Linux 32bit/AMD64 or Windows 32bit/AMD64 is 
required for prebundled BerkeleyDB libraries to run, OR</li>
<li>Any platform that will run Java 5 and BerkeleyDB 5.0.</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>
An API reference in the form of Javadocs is available online and it is also
included within this distribution for offline use:
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.hypergraphdb.org/javadocs/hgcore/index.html">Online HyperGraphDB Javadocs</a></li>
