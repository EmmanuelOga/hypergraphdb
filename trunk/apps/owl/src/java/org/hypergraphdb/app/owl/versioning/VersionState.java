/**
 * <p>
 * Represents the state of a {@link Versioned} object in a way that it can
 * be compared to the state of other copies of the same object. This is 
 * essentially an abstraction of what one would call the "version" of an
 * object. 
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Comparison gives a logical ordering of versions. Because version
 * history is not linear, this ordering is not trivial and can't simply
 * be obtained from a chronological ordering. For purposes of <code>VersionState</code>
 * comparison, we say the a state A is prior to state B (or that B is a 
 * subsequent to A) if B was reached from A as a result of new revisions being
 * applied to A. The two states A and B are divergent if there a revision applied
 * to A that are not part of B and vice versa (i.e. when the two state evolved in
 * parallel rather in sequence).   
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The purpose of this <code>VersionState</code> concept is not only to compare
 * whether two versioned objects, but also to compute deltas: given version state A
 * and version state B for a versioned object V, compute all necessary changes to
 * reach B from A, for example. The delta is expressed as a set of {@link Revision}s.
