#summary The Framework for Communication Activities

= Introduction =

HyperGraph peers communicate through structured messages following a broad communication framework based on the Agent Communication Language (ACL) established by the FIPA standard (see http://www.fipa.org), which itself evolved from the Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language (KQML - see http://www.cs.umbc.edu/kqml/). In essence, the message framework defines a set of communication (or speech) acts that roughly formalise the intention of the communicating agent. 

Following the agent metaphor, conceptually each communication act is performed within the context of accomplishing a given goal (or task). The "desire" to accomplish such a goal is always going to be initiated by one of the peers. The context of communication between peers is captured as an _activity_. Each such activity has a local representation at each peer participating in it, and is identified by a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier). 

Thus, peers perform tasks (i.e. accomplish goals) by running asynchronous activities locally and communicating their state and results via speech act messages. The flow of those activities is orchestrated by a framework that provides the following elements:

  # A peer-to-peer infrastructure based on the JXTA framework (see https://jxta.dev.java.net/), including peer discovery and relay communication over firewalls.
  # Message formatting and parsing using JSON syntax (see http://www.json.org). Serialization for common runtime HyperGraphDB objects (such as queries), Java beans as well as HyperGraphDB atoms is implemented and it is possible to plug in custom object serialization.
  # Pluggable behaviour in the form of `BootstrapPeer` implementations
  # Management and scheduling of activities. Activities can be implemented either as "roll your own" general message handlers or as framework-managed finite-state machines. Activities can also be in a parent-child relationship. 
  # A set of predefined services such as replication and a straightforward client-server access to HyperGraphDB instances.
 

= Activities =

Activities in the HyperGraphDB peer-to-peer framework are the asynchronous processes through which peers communicate. An activity will generally represent a particular task to be accomplished or a sub-task of a larger task. An activity spans any number of peers at any given time.

Activities accomplish their task in discrete units of work that are scheduled to run in the peer thread pool. The lifetime and scheduling of activities is orchestrated by an instance of `org.hypergraphdb.peer.workflow.ActivityManager`. In order to ensure proper sequencing/ordering of those units of work, each activity has an associated queue of actions to be performed. In general, an action simply amounts to the handling of incoming message and modifying the internal activity state somehow, but it is possible to add actions to the queue that are unrelated to messages.

The ActivityManager is responsible for handling all incoming messages and dispatching them according to the following algorithm:

  # If the message refers to an activity already existing locally, then schedule an action to handle with that activity's own queue.
  # Otherwise, create a new activity, *change its workflow state to Started* and schedule the message handling action only then.

Activities are identified between peers through a UUID that is created at the peer initiating the activity. Initiation itself must be done by calling one of the `ActivityManager.initiateActivity` methods - the different versions allow you to specify a parent activity and/or an event listener (`org.hypergraphdb.peer.workflow.ActivityListener`). Once an activity is initiated, the peer is free to send messages with it. All messages sent in the context of that activity will carry its ID so that other peers can create and subsequently identify their own local representations.

Each activity is always in one and only one symbolic _workflow_ state that roughly defines its lifecycle. Activity implementations then maintain any additional needed state as member variables of the implementing class. Workflow states are detailed in the following section.

== Workflow States ==

Finite state machines (FSMs) are a generally good paradigm for implementing asynchronous processes. And even if a particular activity implementation is not entirely based on the FSM concept, its lifecycle will always follow a pattern where the activity is created, started and then it finishes (successfully or not). So the framework mandates the use of a few basic workflow states to capture this very pattern. And it also allows for the definition of an arbitrary number of custom ones so as to facilitate implementations following the FSM paradigm. The predefined states are summarized in the following table:

|| *State Constant* || *Description* ||
|| Limbo || This state represents activities that have been created as Java objects, but are not actually running because they haven't been initiated. ||
|| Started || Represents activities that are currently running, that have been initiated either originally by the current peer or through a message that was received by some other peer. This state is not the only possible state representing a running activity. All custom defined states also represent a currently running (i.e. "active") activity. ||
|| Completed || Represents a state where the activity has completed successfully. Once an activity enters this state, it cannot be changed. ||
|| Failed || Represents a state where the activity has failed to complete, most likely due to some exception. Once an activity enters this state, it cannot be changed. ||
|| Canceled || Represents a state where the activity that was explicitly canceled. Once an activity enters this state, it cannot be changed. ||

The `Limbo` state is in effect only after a new activity was created at a peer, but hasn't been scheduled to execute yet. As soon as it scheduled to execute, its state is changed to `Started` by the framework. Once an activity leaves the `Limbo` state, it can never return to it. The three states `Completed`, `Failed` and `Canceled` are terminal in that once an activity enters them, it can't go to another state and it will never be scheduled for execution again. 

Note that workflow states, and for that matter any other internal implementation state data, are *local* to a peer. Thus while one peer may have an activity in a `Failed` state, another may have it in a `Started` state. 

Workflow states are implemented by the `org.hypergraphdb.peer.workflow.WorkflowState` class which provides atomic operations for changing the state and allows for listeners of state changes to be registered:

{{{
public class WorkflowState
{
   // ....

   // Change the state the 'newState' only if it's currently 'oldState'
   public boolean compareAndAssign(WorkflowStateConstant oldState, WorkflowStateConstant newState)

   // Change the state to 'newState' regardless of current state
   public void assign(WorkflowStateConstant newState)
}
}}} 

both of the above methods will throw an exception if the instance is currently in one of the terminal states. 

The `WorkflowStateConstant` type of the parameters that you see above is that type of all workflow state constants. The implementation is akin to an open-ended enum - a pool of constants is maintained and any custom workflow state constant must be explicitly registered with the pool before it's being used by calling the static `WorkflowState.makeStateConstant(String name)` method. Each constant is identified by a name and this method ensures that there are no duplicate state constants so it is safe to compare them using the Java `==` operator. Given a name, you can retrieve the constant from the pool with `WorkflowState.toStateConstant(String name)` which will throw an exception if there's no constant with this name. 

The `WorkflowStateConstant` is simply an immutable version (an extension) of `WorkflowState`. To create a brand new mutable `WorkflowState`, call one of the static methods `WorkflowState.makeState(WorkflowStateConstant c)` or `WorkflowState.makeState()`. The latter method assume a default initial value of `WorkflowState.Limbo`.

To create custom state constant, it is customary to simply declare them as final static fields in some class:

{{{
    public static final WorkflowStateConstant Started = WorkflowState.makeStateConstant("Started");
    public static final WorkflowStateConstant Completed = WorkflowState.makeStateConstant("Completed");
    // etc...
}}}

The names that you give are case-sensitive. That may be important if you are using Java annotations in combination with the provided `FSMActivity` implementation.
