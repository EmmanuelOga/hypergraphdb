#summary The Framework for Communication Activities

= Introduction =

HyperGraph peers communicate through structured messages following a broad communication framework based on the Agent Communication Language (ACL) established by the FIPA standard (see http://www.fipa.org), which itself evolved from the Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language (KQML - see http://www.cs.umbc.edu/kqml/). In essence, the message framework defines a set of communication (or speech) acts that roughly formalise the intention of the communicating agent. 

Following the agent metaphor, conceptually each communication act is performed within the context of accomplishing a given goal (or task). The "desire" to accomplish such a goal is always going to be initiated by one of the peers. The context of communication between peers is captured as an _activity_. Each such activity has a local representation at each peer participating in it, and is identified by a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier). 

Thus, peers perform tasks (i.e. accomplish goals) by running asynchronous activities locally and communicating their state and results via speech act messages. The flow of those activities is orchestrated by a framework that provides the following elements:

  # A peer-to-peer infrastructure based on the JXTA framework (see https://jxta.dev.java.net/), including peer discovery and relay communication over firewalls.
  # Message formatting and parsing using JSON syntax (see http://www.json.org). Serialization for common runtime HyperGraphDB objects (such as queries), Java beans as well as HyperGraphDB atoms is implemented and it is possible to plug in custom object serialization.
  # Pluggable behaviour in the form of `BootstrapPeer` implementations
  # Management and scheduling of activities. Activities can be implemented either as "roll your own" general message handlers or as framework-managed finite-state machines. Activities can also be in a parent-child relationship. 
  # A set of predefined services such as replication and a straightforward client-server access to HyperGraphDB instances.
 

= Activities =

Activities in the HyperGraphDB peer-to-peer framework are the asynchronous processes through which peers communicate. An activity will generally represent a particular task to be accomplished or a sub-task of a larger task. An activity spans any number of peers at any given time.

Each activity is always in one and only one symbolic _workflow_ state that roughly defines its lifecycle. Activity implementations then maintain any additional needed state as member variables of the implementing class. The framework mandates the use of a few basic workflow states and allows for the definition of an arbitrary number of custom ones. The predefined states are summarized in the following table:

|| *State Constant* || *Description* ||
|| Limbo || This state represents activities that have been created as Java objects, but are not actually running because they haven't been initiated. ||
|| Started || Represents activities that are currently running, that have been initiated either originally by the current peer or through a message that was received by some other peer. This state is not the only possible state representing a running activity. All custom defined states ||
|| Completed || Represents a state where the activity has completed successfully. Once an activity enters this state, it cannot be changed. ||
|| Failed || Represents a state where the activity has failed to complete, most likely due to some exception. Once an activity enters this state, it cannot be changed. ||
|| Canceled || Represents a state where the activity that was explicitly canceled. Once an activity enters this state, it cannot be changed. ||
