#summary Compiling HGDB from Source Code and Deployment

HyperGraphDB consists of a core component implementing the nuts and bolts of the database itself together with several applications in different domains. Some of the applications have dependencies on others and all have a dependency on the `management` component. 

Deployment consists of copying relevant files to your application and setting a few JVM runtime properties. In general, HyperGraphDB is used as a library so it very much depends on your specific application how and which components are being deployed. 

= Source Code Directory Structure =

Source code is organized in the following top-level directories:

|| apps || All HGDB application modules. There's on directory per application module under `apps` ||
|| core || The core of HGDB, including the distributed version. ||
|| viewer || A component for visualization of HGDB graphs. ||
|| test || Unit tests, mainly for the core component. ||
|| doc || Some documentation, obsolete as now all documentation is in Wiki form. ||

The directory structure under core, viewer and each application modules roughly follows the pattern:

|| src || The actual source code. Sub-divided under `java`, possibly `config` and possibly other languages. ||
|| jars || 3d party Java libraries dependencies for that particular component. ||
|| etc. || Possibly some other self-explanatory directories depending on the component. ||

= Compilation =

Compilation is done with the ANT build system (see http://ant.apache.org/). You can compile everything or individual components with the top-level ant script. Or you can compile individual components from their own home directories by running their respective ant scripts.
