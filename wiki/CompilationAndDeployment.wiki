#Compiling HGDB from Source Code and Deployment

HyperGraphDB consists of a core component implementing the nuts and bolts of the database itself together with several applications in different domains. Some of the applications have dependencies on others and all have a dependency on the `management` component. 

Deployment consists of copying relevant files to your application and setting a few JVM runtime properties. In general, HyperGraphDB is used as a library so it very much depends on your specific application how and which components are being deployed.
