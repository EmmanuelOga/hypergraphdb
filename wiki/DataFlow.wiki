#summary Distributed Dataflow

== Introduction ==

Flow-based programming is a powerful computational model that is becoming ever more relevant  in today's highly concurrent multi-core, distributed systems. It is more powerful and as scalable as something like map-reduce. The premise is very simple: computation is described in terms of black-box processes with well defined inputs and outputs. Each process runs in its own thread, reads inputs from a set of input channels, does something and then writes output to a set of output channels. There is no globally shared data and therefore there are no race conditions possible. 

The dataflow HyperGraphDB application component offers an implementation of this concept that is distributed across machines. The flow network of processes and channels is represented as a hypergraph.

This is a module from a project called Disko that will (hopefully very soon) be extracted from there and released as a HyperGraphDB application component. It relies on the HyperGraphDB's peer-to-peer framework to implement distributed flow channels.
