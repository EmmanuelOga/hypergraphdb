#summary HyperGraphDB Core Tests.

= Introduction =

The test suite is written using TestNG (testng.org), which is a bit of a better jUnit though it suffers from the same verbosity problem, but it's a well-known and popular framework.

Because of Maven peculiarities, there are two test sub-projects: 

  * `test` which contains common test related utility classes, and data (in the form of Java beans and datasets) to use in other tests.
  * `testcore` which contains the test suite of the core package.
