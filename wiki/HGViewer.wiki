#summary Overview, building and installing.

= Introduction =

As its name implies HGViewer is an application that is meant to visually represent parts of a given HyperGraph instance. It can be used as a standalone application or as a embeddable component. HGViewer is based on [http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/jazz/index.shtml Piccolo] project, which provides very useful visual features such as: zooming interface, infinite canvas, scene/camera support, etc.       

== Installing from Source Code == 

The HGViewer source code resides in the [http://code.google.com/p/viewer/source/checkout  Subversion repository] and releases are structured following standard Subversion conventions:

  * The main branch containing latest development code can be found under `trunk`.
  * Each release can be found under `tags`.

== Source Code Directory Structure ==

Source code is organized in the following top-level directories:

|| `src/` || The source code. Sub-divided under `java` ||
|| `jars/` || Third-party Java library dependencies for the HGViewer. ||

= Compiling the Source =

HGViewer uses the [http://ant.apache.org ANT build system]. You can compile, build and zip the distribution with the top-level ant script. The only prerequisite is the HyperGraphDB jar which you can take from the HyperGraphDB distribution or build from source. For more information see [http://code.google.com/p/hypergraphdb/wiki/IntroInstall]. Place the hgdbfull.jar in the project's top directory or change the value of hgdb_jar property to point to HyperGraphDB jar.   

The following table describes the three targets used to build HyperGraphDB for deployment:

|| *Target* || *Result* || *Contents* ||
|| `jar` || `hgviewer.jar` || Creates the HGViewer jar. ||
|| `dist-win` || `hgviewer-dist-win.zip` || Creates zipped Windows distribution. ||
|| `dist-lin` || `hgviewer-dist-lin.zip` || Creates zipped Linux distribution. ||

*Tip*: Use the command `ant -p` to list all available targets for a project script.

== Downloading and Installing HGViewer ==

All official release packages are located at the ???[http://code.google.com/p/hypergraphdb/downloads/list Google Code downloads area]. The latest build is linked to at [http://www.kobrix.com/hgdb.jsp HyperGraphDB home page].

HyperGraphDB releases are distributed in compressed archive files  (`.tar.gz` for Unix platforms and `.zip` for Windows). To install a distribution, just unzip the archive into a directory of your own choosing. 

== Distribution Archive Content ==

The unzipped archive contains the following:

|| `readme.html`          || General information about the HGViewer disribution. ||
|| `LicensingInformation` || The HGViewer license conditions. ||
|| `hgviewer.jar`         || The HGViewer jar. ||
|| `run.cmd`         || Start script for Windows distribution only. ||
|| `run.sh`         || Start script for Linux distribution only. ||
|| `jars/`                || Third-party Java library dependencies. Note that not all libraries in this directory are needed in every situation. Jar dependencies are described below . ||  
|| `javadoc/` || API documentation in HTML format.||  

== Third-party Java library dependencies ==
The following table describes the HGViewer jar dependencies. It's up to you to decide which of them to include according the way you plan to use HGViewer.
|| `freehep-base.jar`         || Common functionality to all freehep* jars. ||
|| `freehep-graphics2d.jar`   || Common functionality to all freehep* jars. ||
|| `freehep-graphicsio.jar`   || Common functionality to all freehep* jars.. ||
|| `freehep--graphicsio-gif.jar`         ||Export the HGViewer canvas in GIF format. ||
|| `freehep--graphicsio-pdf.jar`         || Export the HGViewer canvas in PDF format. ||
|| `freehep--graphicsio-ps.jar`         || Export the HGViewer canvas in PS format. ||
|| `freehep--graphicsio-svg.jar`         || Export the HGViewer canvas in SVG format. ||
|| `freehep--graphicsio-swf.jar`         || Export the HGViewer canvas in SWF format. ||
|| `l2fprod-common-sheet.jar`         || Needed for GUI sheets used to define/modify node/edge painters. ||
|| `org-netbeans-swing-outline.jar`         || Used for the Object Inspector used to examine the value of currently selected node in the viewer. || 
|| `piccolo.jar`         || Piccolo project jar. ||
|| `piccolox.jar`         || Piccolo project jar. ||
All freehep* jars are used in a single place in the viewer - Export command. If you didn't plan to used it, you could remove these jars. If you gonna use HGViewer inside Seco, you'll not need piccolo, piccolox and l2fprod-common-sheet jars, because they are already included in Seco.

== Running HGViewer ==

HGViewer could be used as a standalone application, as part of Seco or embedded in a different application.
===Standalone===    
Edit the JAVA_HOME and HGDB_HOME variables in run.cmd/run.sh file corresponding to your OS  to point to the relevant directories, the run the batch script. 
===Seco===
Place hgviewer.jar and its dependency jars in the Seco lib directory. Start Seco and open the ViewerInSeco.nb file, then simply follow the short tutorial presented inside.
===Another application===
You can embed HGViewer component in your own application. Here's a sample code:
