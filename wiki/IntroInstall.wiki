#summary Installing HyperGraphDB

Here we describe installation of HyperGraphDB from an official build. If you'd like to build and install the system directly from source, please refer to the [CompilationAndDeployment] page.

= Where do I get it? =

All official builds are located at the [http://code.google.com/p/hypergraphdb/downloads/list Google Code downloads area]. The latest build is linked to at [http://www.kobrix.com/hgdb.jsp HyperGraphDB home page].

= Distribution Archive Content =

The unzipped archive (.tar.gz for Unix platforms and .zip for Windows) contains the following:

|| hypergraphdb.jar || A jar with the core functionality only - the bare minimum needed to run HGDB. ||  
|| hgpeer.jar || A jar containing code needed to run HGDB in a P2P (peer-to-peer) deployment. ||
|| hgdbfull.jar || A jar containing both core functionality and P2P related functionality. Essentially, hgdbfull.jar=hypergraphdb.jar+hgpeer.jar ||
|| jars/ || A directory with third-party dependency Java libraries. Note that not all libraries in this directory are needed in every situation. Only the BerkeleyDB jar file *db.jar* is absolutely needed. ||  
|| native/ || Native libraries needed to run HGDB. While most Unix environments already contain a version of BerkeleyDB in some standard location, it is strongly advised to link to the version provided in the distribution. ||  
|| javadoc/ || API documentation in Javadoc format.||  
|| src/ ||  The source code used to create this build. ||
|| LicensingInformation || Self-explanatory. ||
|| ThirdPartyLicensing || Directory containing licensing information on HGDB dependencies, such as BerkeleyDB||
