#summary Querying in HyperGraphDB.

There is no special purpose query language for HyperGraphDB, yet. Therefore, querying for atoms is performed with a special purpose API. Like in many other database systems, the API is based on conditional expressions that you create, submit to the query system and get back a set of atoms as the result.

    HGQueryCondition condition = new And(new AtomTypeCondition(Book.class), 
                                         new AtomPartCondition("author", "George Bush", ComparisonOperator.EQ));
    HGSearchResult<HGHandle> rs = graph.find(condition);
    try
    {
        while (rs.hasNext())
        {
            HGHandle current = rs.next();
            Book book = graph.get(current);
            System.out.println(book.geTitle());
        }
    }
    finally
    {
        rs.close();
    }
