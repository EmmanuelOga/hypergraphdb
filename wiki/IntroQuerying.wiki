#summary Querying in HyperGraphDB.

There is no special purpose query language for HyperGraphDB, yet. Therefore, querying for atoms is performed with a special purpose API. Like in many other database systems, the API is based on conditional expressions that you create, submit to the query system and get back a set of atoms as the result.
