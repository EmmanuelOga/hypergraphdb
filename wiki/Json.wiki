#summary JSON Storage as Hypergraph Structures.

= Introduction =

[http://json.org JSON] became popular as an XML alternative for human readable structured communication between software components. However, lately it has been touted as a convenient storage data structure by various database systems labeled as "document-oriented databases" where a document is a JSON object stored as a blob and possibly indexed by various properties for quicker retrieval.

The *HGDB mJson* component takes a different approach in storing JSON structures and records them as graphs where each JSON primitive value is stored as a HyperGraphDB node and each object and array as HyperGraphDB link. 

The representation is based on a very small (1 source file) and concise Json library, called mJson developed in the context of the [http://sharegov.org Sharegov] project and described in the following blog entries:

= Get It = 

Maven dependency:

{{{
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.hypergraphdb</groupId>
      <artifactId>hgdbmjson</artifactId>
      <version>1.2</version>
    </dependency>
}}}

If you're not using Maven, here are direct links to get mJson and the HGDB storage component:
