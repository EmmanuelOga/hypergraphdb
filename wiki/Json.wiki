#summary JSON Storage as Hypergraph Structures.

= Introduction =

<a target="_blank" href="http://json.org">JSON</a> became popular as an XML alternative for human readable structured communication between software components. However, lately it has been touted as a convenient storage data structure by various database systems labeled as "document-oriented" where a document is a JSON object stored as a blog and possibly indexed by various properties for quicker retrieval.

The *HGDB mJson* component takes a different approach in storing JSON structures and records them as graphs where each JSON primitive value is stored as a HyperGraphDB node and each object and array as HyperGraphDB link.
