#summary Collects bugs fixes and improvements made in the current dev cycle

  * Made HGRelTypeConstructor into a HGComplexType so that relations can be found by name more easily.
  * Added the HGTransactionContext to the HGTransaction instances. Added the !HyperGraph instance to its associated HGTransactionContext.
  * Added a few more events for finer grained control of atom addition and replacement. Listeners can throw strongly-typed exceptions to abort the transaction.
  * Added collection and List based constructors for LinkCondition and OrderedLinkCondition respectively.
  * Added HGQuery.hg.atomAssert API for "insert ignore" semantics.
  * XMPP interface allows communicating with peers from a chat room only instead of having to manage every peer's roaster separately.
  * Added toString method to HGValueLink for tracing/debugging purposes.
  * Fixed a bug when removing a link with an empty target set.
  * Fixed a bug in SimpleALGenerator and DefaultALGenerator returning incorrect link when it changes.
  * Added HGUtils.dropHyperGraphInstance method to delete a HGDB instance from the filesystem
  * Implemented MVCC (snapshot isolation) transactions, which are now default.
  * Added some more configuration options to HGConfiguration: for the BDB cache and an MVCC flag (applies only to BDB - RAM structures are only MVCC).
  * Added size() method to HGCache interface and implementations.
  * EnumType supports indexing (i.e. enum properties can be indexed by)
  * Added HGConfiguration option to configure the max size of in-memory incidence sets - maxCachedIncidenceSetSize
  * Added HGConfiguration option for catastrophic recovery. 
  * Added 'goBeforeFirst' and 'goAfterLast' methods to HGRandomAccessResult interface.\
  * API Change: ALGenerator now returns a Pair<HGHandle, HGHandle> result set holding both the link to the adjacent atom and the atom itself, while the getCurrentLink method was removed.
