  * Made HGRelTypeConstructor into a HGComplexType so that relations can be found by name more easily.
  * Added the HGTransactionContext to the HGTransaction instances. Added the !HyperGraph instance to its associated HGTransactionContext.
  * Added a few more events for finer grained control of atom addition and replacement. Listeners can throw strongly-typed exceptions to abort the transaction.
