#summary Collects bugs fixes and improvements made in the current dev cycle

  * Made HGRelTypeConstructor into a HGComplexType so that relations can be found by name more easily.
  * Added the HGTransactionContext to the HGTransaction instances. Added the !HyperGraph instance to its associated HGTransactionContext.
  * Added a few more events for finer grained control of atom addition and replacement. Listeners can throw strongly-typed exceptions to abort the transaction.
  * Added collection and List based constructors for LinkCondition and OrderedLinkCondition respectively.
  * Added HGQuery.hg.atomAssert API for "insert ignore" semantics.
  * XMPP interface allows communicating with peers from a chat room only instead of having to manage every peer's roaster separately.
