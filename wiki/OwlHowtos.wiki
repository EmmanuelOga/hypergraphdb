#summary OWL Code Sample

= Introduction =

This page contains code snippets answering "how do I?" type of questions regarding the HyperGraphDB based OWL implementation. I've deliberately avoided extensive text outside code: explanations are in the form of comments.

= Getting Started =

=== Create an OWL repository ===

An OWL repository is associated with HyperGraphDB instance. Depending on the type of functionality you want, you can create one of several variants of a repository:

  * `HGDBOntologyRepository` for a plain repository that just stores OWL data into a database
  * `VHGDBOntologyRepository` allows you to manage versions of an ontology and keep history with operations like commit, rollback etc.
  * `VDHGDBOntologyRepository` allows you to use collaborative versioning with other peers on the network, with operations such pull, push and everything you are familiar with distributed version control systems like GIT or Mercurial.

For example to create a versioned repository, just instantiate with a database location:

{{{
VHGDBOntologyRepository repo = new VHGDBOntologyRepository("/var/hypergraphdb/ontologydatabase");
}}}

=== Import an Existing Ontology into Database ===

=== Make an Ontology Versioned ===

=== Modify a Versioned Ontology ===

=== Create a Version Branch ===
