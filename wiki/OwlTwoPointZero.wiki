#summary OWL 2 Implementation

== What is OWL 2.0 ==

The Ontology Web Language (OWL) 2.0 is a semantic web standard based on Description Logics (DL). More information on the [http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/ W3C OWL 2.0 home page] as well as at the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language OWL 2 Wikipedia topic].

== Implementation ==

The HyperGraphDB implementation of OWL 2.0 is based on the [http://owlapi.sourceforge.net/ OWL API 2.0] which is the _de facto_ standard for OWL. The OWLAPI is made up of interfaces representing the constructs defined by the [http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-syntax/ W3C standard] completely and faithfully. The OWLAPI itself offers a reference implementation of those interfaces where all data is in memory. The HGDB-OWL implementation is a drop-in replacement that has all data automatically and transparently persisted in a HyperGraphDB instance. 

An 
 so that multiple ontologies can be stored in a single HyperGraphDB instance and reasoned over by any of the off-the-shelf OWL reasoners. 

A future goal would be to implement reasoning and persist inferences within HyperGraphDB. 

This component is localed undera apps/owl in the codebase.
