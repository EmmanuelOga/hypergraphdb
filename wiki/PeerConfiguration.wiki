#summary Documents various aspects of peer configuration.

= HGDB Peer Configuration =

Each peer can be configured before start by using a file with the settings in JSON format or by creating a map with the properties (see the Structs helper class). 

|| *Property* || *Description* || *DefaultValue* ||
|| localDB || The path to the local HGDB database this peer is bound to. When omitted, the peer will not be attached to a local database. || none ||
|| tempDB || The path to a temporary HGDB database. This is used to store logs and atoms that were not yet delivered to interested peers. || none ||
|| interfaceType || The class that provides the peers interface. For the current JXTA implementation it should be org.hypergraphdb.peer.jxta.JXTAPeerInterface|| ||
|| jxta || JXTA related configuration that is not introduced in the JXTA PlatformConfig file || null ||
|| threadPoolSize || The number of threads to the peer. Note that this does not include threads normally created by HyperGraphDB itself for cache management and the like. Omit this parameter or specify a value <= 0 if you want to have an unbounded number of threads allocated on the fly - those threads will be cached, reused, and purged only if they remain idle for 60 seconds. || 10 ||

The jxta element has the following elements:
|| *Property* || *Description* || *DefaultValue* ||
|| peerName || A logical name for the peer || HGDBPeer ||
|| peerGroup || The group to which this peer belongs || HGDBGroup ||
|| jxtaDir || The directory where the jxta PlatformConfig file is stored || .jxta ||
|| advertisementTTL || The time-to-live property for advertisements created by the peer (milliseconds) || 10000 ||
|| needsRelay || True if the peer is required to establish a connection with a relay before starting || false ||
|| needsRendezVous || True if the peer is required to establish a connection with a rendezvous before starting || false ||
|| mode || The mode in which the peer will start. Can be one of the following: _ADHOC_ (peers are part of an ad-hoc network), _EDGE_ (the peer will use relays if they are configured), _RELAY_ (the peer will act as a relay), _RENDEZVOUS_ (the peer will act as a rendezvous), _RENDEZVOUS_RELAY_ (peer will be both a rendezvous and a relay) || ADHOC ||
|| relays || A list with relays that can be used || empty list ||
|| rdvs || A list with rendezvous that can be used || empty list ||
|| tcp || Controls TCP transport settings (see below) || null ||
|| http || Controls HTTP transport settings (see below) || null ||

For the transport type, the following properties are available:
|| *Property* || *Description* || *DefaultValue* ||
|| enabled || Controls if the transport is on or off || true ||
|| incoming || Use transport for incomming connections || true || 
|| outgoing || Use transport for outgoing connections || true || 
|| port || The transport listening port || 9701 for tcp, 9901 for http || 
|| startPort || The lowest port on which the TCP Transport will listen if configured to do so. Valid values are -1, 0 and 1-65535. The -1 value is used to signify that the port range feature should be disabled. The 0 specifies that the Socket API dynamic port allocation should be used. || 9701 ||
|| endPort || The highest port on which the TCP Transport will listen if configured to do so. Valid values are -1, 0 and 1-65535. The -1 value is used to signify that the port range feature should be disabled. The 0 specifies that the Socket API dynamic port allocation should be used || 9799 ||

If a more fine grained control over jxta is required, a PlatformConfig file can be placed in the configured jxta directory. HGDB will load that file and override the values configured in the HGDB config file.

== Configuration file example ==

=== Minimal configuration ==

{{{
{
"hasLocalStorage"	: true,
"interfaceType"		: "org.hypergraphdb.peer.jxta.JXTAPeerInterface"
}
}}}

=== Peer with name ===

{{{
{
"hasLocalStorage"	: true,
"interfaceType"	: "org.hypergraphdb.peer.jxta.JXTAPeerInterface",

"jxta"		:
{
	"peerName"	: "MyPeer",
	"peerGroup"	: "MyGroup"
}
}
}}}

=== Configure the directories used by hgdb ===
{{{
{
"hasLocalStorage"	: true,
"localDB"	: "./hgdb/mainDb",
"tempDB"	: "./hgdb/tempDb",

"interfaceType"	: "org.hypergraphdb.peer.jxta.JXTAPeerInterface",

"jxta"		:
{
	"jxtaDir"	: "./hgdb/.jxta",
	"peerName"	: "MyPeer",
	"peerGroup"	: "MyGroup"
}
}
}}}

=== Configure tcp and http settings  ===
{{{
{
"hasLocalStorage"	: true,
"localDB"	: "./hgdb/mainDb",
"tempDB"	: "./hgdb/tempDb",

"interfaceType"	: "org.hypergraphdb.peer.jxta.JXTAPeerInterface",

"jxta"		:
{
	"jxtaDir"	: "./hgdb/.jxta",
	"peerName"	: "MyPeer",
	"peerGroup"	: "MyGroup",
	"tcp"		:
	{
		"enabled"	: true,
		"port"		: 9702,
	},
	"http"		:
	{
		"enabled"	: true,
		"port"		: 9703
	}
}
}
}}}

=== Peer uses relay === 
{{{
{
"hasLocalStorage"	: true,
"localDB"	: "./hgdb/mainDb",
"tempDB"	: "./hgdb/tempDb",

"interfaceType"	: "org.hypergraphdb.peer.jxta.JXTAPeerInterface",

"jxta"		:
{
	"jxtaDir"	: "./hgdb/.jxta",
	"peerName"	: "MyPeer",
	"peerGroup"	: "MyGroup",
	
	"mode"		: "EDGE",
	"needsRelay" 	: true,
	"relays" 	: ["tcp://127.0.0.1:9711"]
}
}
}}}

=== Peer uses rendezvous ===
{{{
{
"hasLocalStorage": true,
"localDB"	: "./hgdb/mainDb",
"tempDB"	: "./hgdb/tempDb",

"interfaceType"	: "org.hypergraphdb.peer.jxta.JXTAPeerInterface",

"jxta"		:
{
	"jxtaDir"	: "./hgdb/.jxta",
	"peerName"	: "MyPeer",
	"peerGroup"	: "MyGroup",
	
	"mode"		: "EDGE",
	"needsRendezVous" : true,
	"rdvs" 		: ["tcp://127.0.0.1:9711"]
}
}
}}}

=== Peer is configured as rendezvous and/or relay ===

For rendezvous replace the value of the *mode* property with _RENDEZVOUS_; for relay and rendezvous replace with _RENDEZVOUS_RELAY_
