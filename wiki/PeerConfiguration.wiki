#summary Documents various aspects of peer configuration.

= HGDB Peer Configuration =

Each peer can be configured before start by using a file with the settings in JSON format or by creating a map with the properties (see the Structs helper class). 

|| *Property* || *Description* ||
|| hasLocalStorage || true if the peer will store atoms locally, false if not (will only forward to other peers||
|| localDB || if hasLocalStorage=true then the path to the local HGDB database, otherwise ignored ||
|| tempDB || the path to the temporary HGDB database. This is used to store logs and atoms that were not yet delivered to interested peers||
|| interfaceType || The class that provides the peers interface. For the current JXTA implementation it is org.hypergraphdb.peer.jxta.JXTAPeerInterface||
|| jxta || JXTA related configuration that is not introduced in the JXTA PlatformConfig file ||


The jxta element has the following elements:
|| *Property* || *Description* ||
|| peerName || A logical name for the peer ||
|| peerGroup || The group to which this peer belongs ||
|| jxtaDir || The directory where the jxta PlatformConfig file is stored || 
|| advertisementTTL || The time-to-live property for advertisements created by the peer ||
|| needsRelay || True if the peer is required to establish a connection with a relay before starting ||
|| needsRendezVous || True if the peer is required to establish a connection with a rendezvous before starting ||
|| mode || The mode in which the peer will start. Can be one of the following: _ADHOC_ (peers are part of an ad-hoc network), _EDGE_ (the peer will use relays if they are configured), _RELAY_ (the peer will act as a relay), _RENDEZVOUS_ (the peer will act as a rendezvous), _RENDEZVOUS_RELAY_ (peer will be both a rendezvous and a relay) ||

An example of an adhoc peer configuration:

{{{
{
"hasLocalStorage": true,
"localDB"	: "./DBs/Server1DB",
"tempDB"	: "./DBs/Server1TempDB",

"interfaceType"	: "org.hypergraphdb.peer.jxta.JXTAPeerInterface",
"jxta"		:
	{
		"peerName"		: "Server1",
		"peerGroup"		: "TestHGDBGroup",
		"jxtaDir"		: "./.jxta/Server1",
		"advertisementTTL" 	: 10000,
		"needsRelay" 		: false,
		"needsRendezVous"	: false,
		"mode"			: "RENDEZVOUS_RELAY"
	}
}
}}}

= JXTA Configuration =

If a peer is started without a PlatformConfig file, one will be generated based on the _mode_ property. The file can be further modified in order to tune various settings available in JXTA. Here are a few PlatformConfig files that can be used as starting points to configure your peer (replace the PeerID and Name with your own values):

|| Relay || http://hypergraphdb.googlecode.com/files/Relay || ||
|| Edge using relay & rendezvous || http://hypergraphdb.googlecode.com/files/RelayClient || Make sure you replace the IP address and port number with the address and port of the relay/rendezvous you are using ||
