#summary Documents various aspects of peer configuration.

= Top Level Configuration =

Each peer can be configured before start by using a file with the settings in JSON format or by creating a map with the properties (see the Structs helper class). 

|| *Property* || *Description* || *DefaultValue* ||
|| peerName || A logical name for the peer || HGDBPeer ||
|| bootstrap || The list of bootstrapping operation to invoke upon startup. This list essentially defines what the peer will do. Each bootstrapping operations plugs in some behavior into the peer and custom bootstrapping is of course possible. More on the syntax and a list of predefined bootstrapping operations can be found below.  || none ||
|| localDB || The path to the local HGDB database this peer is bound to. When omitted, the peer will not be attached to a local database. || none ||
|| tempDB || The path to a temporary HGDB database. This is used to store logs and atoms that were not yet delivered to interested peers. || none ||
|| interfaceType || The class that provides the peers interface. For the current JXTA implementation it should be org.hypergraphdb.peer.jxta.JXTAPeerInterface|| ||
|| jxta || JXTA related configuration that is not introduced in the JXTA PlatformConfig file || null ||
|| threadPoolSize || The number of threads to the peer. Note that this does not include threads normally created by HyperGraphDB itself for cache management and the like. Omit this parameter or specify a value <= 0 if you want to have an unbounded number of threads allocated on the fly - those threads will be cached, reused, and purged only if they remain idle for 60 seconds. || 10 ||

= The `bootstrap` element =

This configuration element lists implementation of the `org.hypergraphdb.peer.BootstrapPeer` interface. It's an array of two element structures - one specifying the implementation class and the other an arbitrary nested configuration structure to be passed to the class's `bootstrap` method. For example:

{{{

{
...
"bootstrap" :
 [ {"class" : "org.hypergraphdb.peer.bootstrap.ReplicationBootstrap", "config" : {}}]
...
}
}}}

This defines a list of only one bootstrapping operation implemented by the `ReplicationBootstrap` class and with a empty configuration. Note that the configuration is assumed to be an object structure, it can't be a primitive literal or an array.
