#summary Protege OWL Editor Plugin

= What Is It? =

The HGDB Protege Plugin integrates HyperGraphDB backed storage for OWL 2.0 ontologies with the popular Protege OWL editor (http://protege.stanford.edu/). The core features supports are:

  # Automatic ontology persistence in HyperGraphDB back-end. Import/Export from/to standard OWL textual formats. All modifications in the editor are automatically persisted in a transactional way. 
  # Versioning of ontologies at the axiom level - every axiom change is recorded and tracked and can be inspected and reverted. That is, version management support full history, commits, rollbacks, reverts etc. 
  # Team features include sharing ontologies on a common repository and managing versions following the Subversion model with a centralized location. Merging of change sets is supported, but branching is not available yet (planned for next release).
  # A few extra improvements to Protege itself that help dealing with large-scale ontologies such as search box for long lists of individuals or properties in some dialog boxes.

= Installation and Compatibility =

Protege itself is build on OSGI and the plugin comes in the forms of several bundles that you install simply by copying over in your Protege home installation directory.
