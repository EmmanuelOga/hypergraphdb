#summary Idioms for working with queries and results.

= Introduction =

Here are a few idioms and code snippets that show how to do queries with HGDB and how to work with result sets. 

= The Queries API =

There is no query language for HGDB at the time of this writing, though we've outlined some ideas on TowardsHyperGraphQueryLanguage page. Queries are build up as query conditions, classes implementing the `HGQueryCondition` interface, and submitted via a call to `HyperGraph.find`. For example:

{{{
HGQueryCondition cond = new And(new AtomTypeCondition(MyLink.class), new IncidentCondition(atom));
HGSearchResult<HGHandle> rs = graph.find(cond);
while (rs.hasNext()) System.out.println(rs.next());
rs.close();
}}}

A more coding friendly API is provided by the `HGQuery.hg` class which, with Java 5 static imports, can be used like this:

{{{
import org.hypergraphdb.HGQuery.hg;

HGQueryCondition cond = hg.and(hg.type(MyLink.class), hg.incident(atom));
HGSearchResult<HGHandle> rs = graph.find(cond);
// etc...
}}}

*It is very important* that `HGSearchResult` instances be closed properly and promptly (i.e. as soon as possible). They will generally hold an open cursor on the filesystem and must be closed like any other external resource, be it an open file or a socket connection, or an SQL result set. And unlike the example above, as a good coding practice working with a `HGSearchResult` should always be enclosed in a `try ... finally` block:

{{{
HGSearchResult<HGHandle> rs = graph.find(cond);
try { use rs here } 
finally { HGUtils.closeNoException(rs); }
}}}

Note the use of `HGUtils.closeNoException' above. In the HGDB API, we've chosen not to throw any checked exceptions because it's annoying when you don't care about them. However, as with many other HGDB methods, a call the `HGSearchResult` may well throw an `HGException`. If you don't want that exception to propagate and interrupt your program, then the `HGUtils.closeNoException` is a convenient shorthand for code such as `try { rs.close(); } catch (Throwable t) { }`.

The `HGQuery.hg` interface offers a few additional convenience methods to avoid having to
