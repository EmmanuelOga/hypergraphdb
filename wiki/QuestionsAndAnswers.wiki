===Creating a graph based on existing API===

First of all, you need to decide which of your classes represent relationships and which represent basic data. Instances of classes that represent basic data can be added into a HyperGraphDB instances without modification as atoms of arity 0 (meaning that they don't point to other atoms). Classes that represent relationships need to be transformed into HyperGraphDB links, i.e. implementations of the [http://www.kobrix.com/javadocs/hgcore/org/hypergraphdb/HGLink.html HGLink] interface.


===Can I make any object into a link?===

You can turn any object into a hypergraph link by wrapping it up as a [http://www.kobrix.com/javadocs/hgcore/org/hypergraphdb/HGValueLink.html HGValueLink]. This way you don't need to modify the Java class of the object. The object will be stored as the "payload" value of the link and it will still represent a relationship in the graph.
