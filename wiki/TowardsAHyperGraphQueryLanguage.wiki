=Querying=

When thinking about querying a database, the natural starting point is the SQL paradigm: given some data set, restrict it with some set of criteria to obtain a result. But there are more general views on querying, more close to the everyday meaning of "soliciting the answer to some question", given that we can express the question in a way meaningful to the system. Prolog is an example of this sort of generalized querying capabilities where rule-based inference of new facts are part of the process. Given the generality of HGDB, we are tempted to define similar mechanism where fairly complex queries can be expressed and where the query processing itself is highly customizable. 

This would be a very long research project and a language would have to evolve based on experience with real-world applications and the development of auxiliary algorithms. So we restrict the scope for now to an already difficult problem of expressing and looking for structural/data patterns within a HyperGraph database.
