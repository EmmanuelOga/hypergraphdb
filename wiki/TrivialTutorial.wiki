#summary Minimalistic Getting-Started

DISCLAIMER: this page is written by a User. It is not an "official" hypergraphDB document. It is as of yet, incomplete.

=Is it difficult to understand, setup and use HypergraphDB?=
While with hypergraphDB you can do fancy things, and while there are some things that are not directly obvious, the concepts behind HypergraphDB are actually not difficult. It follows a very consistent logic. And it can be a very useful tool for normal, non-fancy things too. 
The intention of this tutorial is to prove that generally, it is not difficult to use either, and to improve documentation on those edges where things are non-obvious.
Since version 1.2, it no longer is difficult to setup, since there no longer is the need for a native library. It now integrates with Maven and has excellent JSON support (among many other things).

=How to instantiate HyperGraphDB?=
{{{
HyperGraph graph = new HyperGraph("/home/schopenhauer/hgdbData/");
// do things. Then close it:
graph.close()
}}}
In production systems, you are recommended to ensure graph.close by wrapping code in try / finally blocks. If you manage several hypergraph instances, use HGEnvironment.get(location).

=How to store and retrieve data? - the trivial way=
{{{
String someObject = "Lorem ipsum";
HGHandle handle1 = graph.add(someObject);
System.out.println(graph.get(handleToSomeObject));
System.out.println(((String) graph.get(handle1)).toUpperCase());
}}}
->
Lorem ipsum
LOREM IPSUM

Notes:
   * graph.add(...) returnes a "handle" with which you can access the datum directly (as seen in graph.get a line below). A handle generally is an auto-generated database ID. 
  *  using add/get to store and retrieve data is not necessarily the typical way hypergraphdb is used because:
  # graph.get() requires you to know the handle. This is often not the case, especially when you want data that you did not store just moments ago (hence most of the time! :-) ). Therefore most accesses typically happen by querying. 
  # If graph.add(someObject) is called more than once (for example by accident, each time you run a given program), you would end up with duplicates that can be disturbing when querying.
  * the second println demonstrate that we get a fully functional java object, in that case, it has a working toUpperCase method. This shows that hypergraphDB is not only a graph-database, but also a full object-oriented database.



=How to store and retrieve data without knowning the handle? - querying basics=
Querying is done conveniently by using the static helper class "hg":
{{{
import org.hypergraphdb.HGQuery.hg.*;
}}}


We stored only one element in our database, so we would immediately find "Lorem ipsum" simply by querying for type String:
{{{
System.out.println(hg.getOne(graph, hg.type(String.class)));
}}}
-> "Lorem ipsum";


hg.getOne returns you any one (of possibly many) matching result as a ready-to-use object, just as did graph.get. But often we have several items that match a certain criteria. We get can get those packed in a List, with hg.getAll:
In order to have two atoms, we just add the same object as above:
{{{
HGHandle handle2 = graph.add(someObject);
}}}

and then query for all Strings:
{{{
        for (Object s : hg.getAll(graph, hg.type(String.class)))
            System.out.println(s);
}}}

->
dolor sit amet
dolor sit amet

We get two results here, that happen to be distinct duplicate copies of the same data (we prove that later).

As you see, querying is generally used in one of this ways:
{{{
hg.getOne (graphInstance, QueryCondition); // ->  any one matching object.
hg.getAll (graphInstance, QueryCondition); // ->  all matching objects as a List.
}}}

where "QueryCondition" in our example is hg.type(String.class), but of course there is more.


=How to query for handles?=
Sometimes you need handles. To query for them is easy. It's the same as with getOne/getAll, but instead of h.getOne you use hg.findOne. Instead of hg.getAll, use hg.findAll. 

We use this to confirm that we created actual duplicate atoms in the "dolor sit amet" example above. We printout the handles, and check for equality with the handles obtained before: 

{{{
         for (Object s : hg.findAll(graph, hg.type(String.class)))
        {
            System.out.println(s);
            System.out.println((s.equals(handle1) || s.equals(handle2)));
        }
}}}

->

true
dceadb0c-318b-4249-917a-559d2f077fcc
true


=How to store data uniquely?=
Now, how to make sure that a given data is stored only once, even when -by accident or not- the data is stored twice?

{{{
String object2 = "dolor sit amet";
HGHandle noDup1 = hg.assertAtom(graph, object2);
HGHandle noDup2 = hg.assertAtom(graph, object2);  //trying hard to duplicate
System.out.println("Are those two handles duplicates, i.e. two distinct handles? : " + (!noDup1.equals(noDup2)));
}}}

-> 
"Are those two handles duplicates, i.e. two distinct handles? : false"

Note that - logically - there is a cost associated with due to checking. If you don't need unique atoms, graph.add is faster.

=How to create Links and query for Links?=

Till now there was nothing graph, only object-oriented database functionality. We also did not do particularly interesting queries.

Let's make a link and query for it:
{{{
        HGHandle duplicateLink = graph.add(new HGRelType("duplicates!", handle1, handle2));
        List<HGHandle> dupsList = hg.findAll(graph, hg.link(handle1, handle2));
        System.out.println("querying for link returned that duplicate Link? :" + dupsList.contains(duplicateLink));
}}}
=>
querying for link returned that duplicate Link? :true


=How to query for properties?=
Consider you have a Bean like this:

{{{
public class Name {
    private String surname;
    public String getSurname() { return surname; }
    public void setSurname(String surname) { this.surname = surname; }

    private String firstName;
    public String getFirstName() { return firstName; }
    public void setFirstName(String firstName) { this.firstName = firstName;  }

    public Name(){};
}
}}}

and you stored some names:
{{{
          Name b = new Name();
            b.setSurname("Hugo");
            b.setFirstName("Victor");
            graph.add(b);

            Name c = new Name();
            c.setSurname("Chavez");
            c.setFirstName("Hugo");
            graph.add(c);

            Name d = new Name();
            d.setSurname("Camus");
            d.setFirstName("Albert");
            graph.add(d);
}}}

then in order to query, you first have to define indices:
{{{
    HGHandle bTypeH = graph.getTypeSystem().getTypeHandle(Name.class);
        graph.getIndexManager().register(new ByPartIndexer(bTypeH, "surname"));
        graph.getIndexManager().register(new ByPartIndexer(bTypeH, "firstName"));
        graph.runMaintenance();
}}}

Querying example:
{{{
        List<Name> hugos = hg.getAll(graph, hg.and(hg.type(Name.class), hg.or(hg.eq("surname", "Hugo"), hg.eq("firstName", "Hugo"))));
        List<Name> noHugos = hg.getAll(graph, hg.and(hg.type(Name.class), hg.not(hg.or(hg.eq("surname", "Hugo"), hg.eq("firstName", "Hugo")))));

        for(Name n : hugos)
                System.out.println("hugo: surname:" + n.getSurname() + " . first name: " + n.getFirstName());

        for(Name n : noHugos)
            System.out.println("No Hugo: surname:" + n.getSurname() + " . first name: " + n.getFirstName());

}}}
