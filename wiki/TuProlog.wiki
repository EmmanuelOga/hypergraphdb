#summary TuProlog interpreter integration with HyperGraphDB.

== What is !TuProlog ==

!TuProlog a pure Java Prolog interpreter developed developed at the University of Bologna, Italy, see its [http://alice.unibo.it/xwiki/bin/view/Tuprolog/ home page] for more information. The architecture of the interpreter is modular which makes relatively easy to extend. It also has a nice interface to Java and small memory footprint. A good, concise description of its features can be found at the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TuProlog TuProlog Wikipedia Page].

== !TuProlog + HyperGraphDB ==

In HyperGraphDB, we forked the codebase to experiment with integrating a Prolog engine for reasoning with HyperGraphDB's atoms. The modularity of !TuProlog permits additions of _predicate libraries_ implemented in Java, but it doesn't permit pluggable implementations of the interpreter's `ClauseStore`. In addition, the integration provides for a very large factbase for the Prolog engine with efficient database style indexing etc.
