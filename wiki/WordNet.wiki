Wordnet is a popular lexical database used in NLP (Natural Language Processing) research. Meaning in Wordnet is defined through _synsets_ - synonym sets that group together words with similar meaning. In addition, the database contains semantic relationships between synsets (e.g. type-token, whole-part etc.). More information can be found on 
the [http://wordnet.princeton.edu/ Wordnet home page at Princeton].

The HyperGraphDB Wordnet application (called henceforth HGWN) is essentially a representation of all the information from WordNet within HyperGraphDB. This includes support for:

  * Querying the DB for a given word.
  * Querying for specific semanthycal or lexical relationship of a given word
  * Morphological analysys - e.g. finding base form of  a given word or collocation

HGWN does not support the so called "polysemy count" - number of uses of a given word in a specific sense as obtained by analyzing several sample texts. This feature is absolete in WordNet too and is left unchanged since 2003.  

==Package Overview==

Main package: org.hypergraphdb.app.wordnet. All Wordnet related classes are to be found underneath this package.

JWNL configuration files are maintained in org.hypergraph.app.wordnet.configuration. They are only needed when Wordnet is initially loaded into HyperGraphDB.

The package org.hypergraphdb.wordnet.data contains 



==Loading WordNet in a HyperGraphDB==

The JWNL (Java WordNet Library) - http://sourceforge.net/projects/jwordnet is used to load the WordNet database files. It is an open-source Java API for accessing WordNet which provides API-level access to WordNet data.
